# LFV - Large file viewer
Files editor often load the whole file into memory to display it. This approach does not work well with large text files, especially when your RAM is limited. This terminal-based file viewer allows you to view large text files (up to 4GB) while using O(1) memory. The file viewer also supports efficient text searching (also O(1) memory).
